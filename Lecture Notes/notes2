Using Graphs to Solve Problems
-------------------------------

1. Translate the problem into graph terminology
2. Build the graph from the problem data
3. Traverse/Search or whatever combination you need

Word Ladders Problem
---------------------

Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list,
find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.
Each transformed word must exist in the word list.
Note:

Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

For there to be a path, beginWord and endWord must be the same length

If there are multiple equal-length paths, choose any of them.

Option A: Try every letter combination in the word, checking to see if the 
result is in the dictionary

Option B: Look through all the words in ther dictionary, find those that
only differ by one letter

sail -> bail
sail -> bail -> boil -> coil -> coal -> boat
