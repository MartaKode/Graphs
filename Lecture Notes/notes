Graphs
----------
Nodes connected by edges
Vertexes
Vertices
Verts

Directed vs undirected:
    Directed has one-way edges

Cyclic vs Acyclic:
    Cyclic has a way to get back to a node you've already visited
    * if it has at least 1 cycle in it, it's cyclic

Weighted edges:
    "Cost" with traversing edges

Traversals:

    Breadth-first traversals
    Depth-first traversals

LL:

cur = head
while cur is not None:
    print(cur)
    cur = cur.next


Binary Tree:

traverse(node):
    if node is None: return

    traverse(node.left)
    print(node)
    traverse(node.right)
